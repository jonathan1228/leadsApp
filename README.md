## Leads App

* Created using Angular, Express, Node.js, and postgreSQL.

* Used knex on the backend, so npm install then in the terminal type knex migrate:latest --env development

* Sorry, no tests for this project. I tried my best to write stubs and mocks for angular's $http using $httpBackend but just couldn't quite get it to work. I know I can figure it out, but I didn't want to spend more time on this project figuring it out, even though I believe testing IS important. I have done unit tests, integration tests, and acceptance tests. I am proficient in doing backend/frontend tests. I am capable of figuring out tools, libraries such as sinon, sinon-promise, mocking node.js' http methods and streaming the data and stubbing the res.on/res.end. My weakness is setting up the boilerplate, but once I get things set up and things are working correctly, I can build on top of the codebase and refactor.

* I will figure out how to mock the $http for my own sake since I don't like having this project without any tests. If you wish to see it, I will glady push it once I figure it out.

* run the project using nodemon and it will be on port 3000
